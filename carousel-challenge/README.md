# Carousel Challenge

Scrimba's how to make a carousel JavaScript challenge. This will be a "Code-Along" tutorial on how to make a carousel **WITHOUT** pulling from an external library (as many companies will have you do). 

## GOAL: 
To showcase my ability to build a carousel **from scratch** using only JavaScript/CSS/HTML without downloading an entire library for image displays. 

## Project End Example:
